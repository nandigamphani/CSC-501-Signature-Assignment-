# CSC-501-Signature-Assignment-
Signature Assignment (SA) is a computer project entitled  “ Designing an algorithm to perform online picture search ”  Background in real world: There are a variety of web search engines which people use to find valuable information. But it is mainly “text based” search. What does it mean that one types “key word” and then get response from web.  New challenge in real world: there are more and more information stored in pictures or graphs, not in text format. It is a new trend in software technology: designing search engine based on graphs.  CSC501 Signature Assignment achieves following CLOs:  Students have to identify key features of a picture, and establish math framework to describe the graph/picture. This step is in the scope of CSC501 CLO “Use discrete structures to create mathematical arguments” Students have to use sets of “vertices and edges” to model the graph/picture. In order to take into consideration of interactions between vertices and edge’s weight or color, they have to construct matrix to represent a graph. The graph and its matrix is unique one-on-one correspondence. This step is in the scope of CSC501 CLO “Construct matrix to represent graph for social network” Students have to design algorithms and write computer program to compare matrices to see the differences between two graphs/pictures. This step is in the scope of CSC501 CLO “Write proofs and induction to validate algorithms”
